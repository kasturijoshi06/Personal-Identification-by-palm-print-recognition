# Personal-Identification-by-palm-print-recognition
This repository contains a MATLAB program to recognize the true user of a system by recognizing the palm print.
The images for this recognition are taken from PolyU Palmprint database. 
This project is an implementation of the paper:
Y. Xu, L. Fei and D. Zhang, "Combining Left and Right Palmprint Images for More Accurate Personal Identification," in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 24, no. 2, pp. 549-559, Feb. 2015.
The dataset, paper and the code is available in this repository.
